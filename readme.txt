Verify customer age at checkout. Cut fraud with photo ID verification. Check purchaser age info.

== Description ==
BlueCheck verifies the age of your customers by automatically grabbing the details they enter into the checkout page and running it through various databases to find a match. If we are unable to find an automated match, we will prompt the user for additional information.

Legally verify customer age during checkout without stopping conversions or showing popups.

* Automatically verify customer age without disrupting the checkout process.
* Verify using name/address, photo ID, or last 4 of SSN.
* In-depth integration into WooCommerce ecosystem including product tags, secondary checks, and more.

= Maximize Conversions =

With BlueCheck, more than 96% of your customers are verified automatically. __Other competitive solutions require an extra 3 clicks and popup during the checkout process to verify age.__ This is because they don’t have the same data access that BlueCheck utilizes and require more user interaction.  With BlueCheck, we pioneered a zero touch verification process helps maintain a high level of checkout conversions.

BlueCheck offers several additional verification types for the remaining customers that cannot be automatically verified including Photo ID verification and verification using the last four digits of their SSN. These alternative methods help to ensure that all of your customers are able to complete verification and you do not lose any sales because a customer could not be verified.

= The Secondary Check - Protect Your Business =

In addition to verifying customers during the checkout, BlueCheck also performs a secondary check of all orders that are placed in your store to ensure there is a verification on file for that order. If there is no verification for the associated order BlueCheck sends an email to the customer requesting that they complete verification. In addition BlueCheck will set the order status in woocommerce to ‘failed’ and add a note to the order saying it was not verified to ensure it is not accidentally fulfilled.

The secondary check combined with the initial verification during checkout helps you avoid legal headaches and prevent sales of age restricted goods to minors.

= Fully Customizable =

BlueCheck can be customized to best suit your business needs. Adding your own logo to the verification modal, setting the minimum age requirement and allowable verification methods by state and country, and even blocking sales to certain states and countries are all possible with BlueCheck.

= Features =

* 96%+ of customers verified without having to enter any additional information.
* Multip[le different verification methods offered.
* Customize verification method and age requirements by State and Country
* Secondary check confirms each placed order was verified.
* Customize the age verification modal with your logo.

This plugin connects to BlueCheck's verification API in order to confirm the age of the customer who is making the purchase on your store and to double check to ensure that all orders placed on your store have been verified. Each time a customer attempts to checkout the customer's full name (first_name, last_name), full address (address_1, address_2, city, state, country, and postal_code), and email is sent to BlueCheck in order to perform the age verification. If the age of the purchaser can not be verified using that data, the user may be asked to submit additional information including a photo of their government ID, a selfie image of themselves with their government ID, their DOB, and the last four digits of their SSN. Each time an order is placed, the customer's full name (first_name, last_name), full address (address_1, address_2, city, state, country, and postal_code), email and the order id number is sent to BlueCheck to ensure that there is an existing age verification for the newly created order.
